      Python is a high-level programming language designed to be easy to read and simple to implement. It is open source, which means it is free to use, even for commercial applications. Python can run on Mac, Windows, and Unix systems and has also been ported to Java and .NET virtual machines.

      Python is considered a scripting language, like Ruby or Perl and is often used for creating Web applications and dynamic Web content. It is also supported by a number of 2D and 3D imaging programs, enabling users to create custom plug-ins and extensions with Python. Examples of applications that support a Python API include GIMP, Inkscape, Blender, and Autodesk Maya.
      
      Scripts written in Python (.PY files) can be parsed and run immediately. They can also be saved as a compiled programs (.PYC files), which are often used as programming modules that can be referenced by other Python programs.
      Pythonâ€™s initial development was spearheaded by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s. Today, it is developed by the Python Software Foundation. Because Python is a multiparadigm language, Python programmers can accomplish their tasks using different styles of programming: object oriented, imperative, functional or reflective. Python can be used in Web development, numeric programming, game development, serial port access and more.

      There are two attributes that make development time in Python faster than in other programming languages:
      
      Python is an interpreted language, which precludes the need to compile code before executing a program because Python does the compilation in the background. Because Python is a high-level programming language, it abstracts many sophisticated details from the programming code. Python focuses so much on this abstraction that its code can be understood by most novice programmers.
      Python code tends to be shorter than comparable codes. Although Python offers fast development times, it lags slightly in terms of execution time. Compared to fully compiling languages like C and C++, Python programs execute slower. Of course, with the processing speeds of computers these days, the speed differences are usually only observed in benchmarking tests, not in real-world operations. In most cases, Python is already included in Linux distributions and Mac OS X machines.
